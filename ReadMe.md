# üéÉ HacktoberFest Starter Project 2018 üéÉ


Use this project to make your first contribution to an open source project on GitHub. Practice making your first pull request to a public repository before doing the real thing!

## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) in partnership with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
- Five quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
- You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## How do I get started?
Register at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ Submit a PR to any public GitHub repository. Quality contributions are encouraged! You can look for open issues labeled "Hacktoberfest" for inspiration.

_Maintaining a repo?_

Create issues labeled or label existing ones ‚ÄúHacktoberfest‚Äù on your GitHub projects to help new contributors know what to work on. Tag any spam or irrelevant PRs with the "invalid" label to disqualify them.

## How do I track my progress?
Log in with your GitHub account at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ to check your progress and stats.

## I completed 5 PRs. When will I receive my t-shirt?
We will start sending out emails with more details on redeeming t-shirts throughout the month. Stay tuned!

## How do I get stickers?
Stickers are included with your t-shirt, once you complete 5 PRs.

## What happens if I complete fewer than 5 PRs by the end of the month?
Unfortunately you will have to submit at least 5 PRs in order to get a T-shirt.
